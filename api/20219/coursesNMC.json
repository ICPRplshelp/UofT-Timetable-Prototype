Deeply embedded within early African history, Egypt was also inextricably linked with the history of many civilizations in the Ancient Near East. From pyramids to mummies and from King Tut to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the course will trace the history of ancient Egypt from its foundation around 3050 BCE to its incorporation into the Roman Empire in the 1st Century BCE. The focus will be on various aspects of Egyptian culture, including the institution of kingship, the role of women, and the characteristic features of Egyptian art, literature, and religion. Emphasis will be placed on the methods by which knowledge about this ancient civilization can be obtained.</p>",

What makes something (an empire or state, or a work of art or music) Islamic? When and how did that which we think of today as Islamic come about? How has “the Islamic” changed over time? With these questions in mind, this course introduces students to major figures, events, themes, institutions, and intellectual currents in Islamic history, from its beginnings in the 7th century to the modern period. Key topics to be covered include the rise and spread of Islam, the Qur’an and the role of Arabic, political thought, law and society, and literary and artistic expressions. Attention is paid to the geographical and ethno-linguistic scope of the Muslim world, demonstrating the diversity of peoples and traditions that make up Islamic civilizations.</p>",

Students will read novels and short stories by prominent Arab authors who have represented marginal social groups in their fiction, including representations of the urban poor, the peasantry, the delinquent, the prostitute, sexual minorities, women who reject normative roles, and the political rebel. These fictional texts address issues such as political resistance and rebellion, economic precarity, and social exclusion. Students will engage with these texts by critically examining the role of literature in narrating unspoken and suppressed histories. The class will also introduce students to theoretical modes of literary analysis and interpretation. All texts will be read in English translation. Authors include Mohamed Choukri, Hanan al-Shaykh, Alifa Rifaat, Sonallah Ibrahim, and Arwa Salih. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.</p>",

Did Jesus really raise Lazarus from the dead? Are miracles necessarily fiction? In this seminar, we will read together many of the most colourful stories of the Bible, sometimes alongside similar stories from the cultural context of ancient Israel, and discuss what genre (history, myth, legend, folktale) they belong to and how this affects our reading of these texts.

Primarily we will use writings by women themselves, such as <em>Memoirs of a Persian Princess: From the Harem to Modernity</em>, 1884-1914, to examine their lives. Interviews with women in <em>Exiled Memories</em> give voice to repressed memories that inhibited female self-development. The memoir <em>Reveille for a Persian Village</em> reveals the challenge of introducing change for females into an isolated rural community<em>. </em>Poems by this early generation vividly reveal their anger, regret, difficulties, and hopes for the future. <em>Memories of a Persian Childhood</em> helps us to appreciate the important role of childhood experience in later choices. Each woman is discussed as an individual and as a product of a period of turbulent social and cultural change in the history of Iran. Restricted to first-year students.

This course will explore the city of Babylon through its texts and archaeology and contrast this data with the way the city has been remembered over the past two thousand years. However, the goal of the course is not only to investigate how myths about Babylon have been constructed throughout the centuries. It will also look at the shortcomings of contemporary academic research on Babylon, and how difficult it is to reconstruct humankind's distant past. Restricted to first-year students.

We then move forward in time to examine how the 1001 Nights was expanded, adapted, and disseminated from then until today. A key transformation moment occurred between 1704-1717 with the publication of Antoine Galland’s French version, composed with the input of Syrian storyteller Hanna Diab. This version was widely disseminated and became a basis for most subsequent modern adaptations. We consider adaptations both before and after this turning point, including manuscripts, translations, novels, ballets, short stories, and films produced around the world. Throughout, we consider the politics and aesthetics of these historical translations, adaptations, and transformations.</p>",

Composed in Persian by the poet Ferdowsi in the late 10th–early 11th centuries, it had a deep and lasting impact not only on Iran, but also on those cultures that came under the influence of Persian language, literature, and courtly traditions. The course examines, in English translation, the <em>Shahnameh</em>’s presentation of the history of the mythical dynasties of the ancient kings of Iran from the creation of the world to the Sasanians, the last historical dynasty to rule Iran before the Muslim Arab conquests. As the <em>Shahnameh </em>was frequently illustrated, attention will also be devoted to the manuscript tradition, which exhibits some of the finest examples of medieval Persian painting.</p>",

From circular communal buildings and the constraints and possibilities they offer, to replastering skulls and making hand-held figurines, to the performance of a ritual text, we link traditional teaching with walking a mile in ancient footwear. Participation in this course requires an active imagination and a willingness to get physical.</p>",

We will examine how Jewish law (<em>halakhah</em>) sometimes conflicts with ideas of egalitarianism particularly in legal disabilities for women such as divorce, lack of access to high-level Torah study, and discrimination in public religious roles. The traditional exemption of women from the obligation of Torah study had great impact on women’s religious responsibility and status. Various movements within Judaism competed in efforts to resolve these difficulties. In this course we will consider to what extent inclusion and egalitarianism have become complementary to traditional Judaism.</p>",

Students then consider how travel narratives in the modern period are transformed due to radical changes in the balance of power between Europe and the Middle East, first reading 19th-century travel narratives to Paris (al-Tahtawi); and then focusing on 20th-century texts that narrate the travels of Arab men and women to Europe and North America (Leila Ahmed, Sayyid Qutb, Nawal al-Saadawi). Students will also read texts that depict encounters with non-Arabs within the modern Arab world, such as literary depictions of American oil workers in the Arab Gulf (Munif). All readings are in English translation.</p>",

Following a review of the relevant terminology (e.g., “warfare” vs “skirmish”) in archaeological literature, we will investigate the archaeological and historical data for a time span that extends from 9,000 to 300 BC. Evidence from archaeological sites (notably violent destructions of ancient settlements) will be compared with available artistic representations of warfare in sculpture, reliefs, inlays, and glyptics, complemented by textual accounts. While the course focuses on Mesopotamia, evidence from Syria, Turkey, Iran, the Levant, and Egypt will also be included.</p>",

The focus is on foundational research and case-studies of materials from around the world with particular attention to material culture from the Middle East, Central America, and East Asia, where University of Toronto researchers have worked, ranging in date from the Neolithic period to the modern day. Class and lab discussions will include critical examination of the application and integration of ceramic petrology in archaeological research design and how petrology can address relevant research questions successfully. Labs comprise eight three-hour sessions during the term, working with the polarized-light microscope to examine and analyze thin-sections.</p>",

At other times, the course focuses on a more narrowly defined geographic region—one country or a group of countries in the Arabic-speaking lands. Readings and discussions emphasize the experiences of broad sectors of the population, not just of elites. This framework of “history from below” also invites scrutiny of historically-marginalized populations (“subalterns”); or at least of silences in the literature about these populations.</p>",
