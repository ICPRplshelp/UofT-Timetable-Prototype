        "courseDescription": "<p>What is the relationship between place and belonging, between territory and memory? How have the experiences of migration and dislocation challenged the modern assumption that the nation-state should be the limit of identification? What effect has the emergence of new media of communication had upon the coherence of cultural and political boundaries? All of these questions and many more form part of the subject matter of Diaspora and Transnational Studies. This introductory course ex-amines the historical and contemporary movements of peoples and the complex issues of identity and experience to which these processes give rise as well as the creative possibilities that flow from movement and being moved. The area of study is comparative and interdisciplinary, drawing from the social sciences, history, the arts and humanities. Accordingly, this course provides the background to the subject area from diverse perspectives and introduces students to a range of key debates in the field, with particular attention to questions of history, globalization, cultural production and the creative imagination.</p>",

It is a city defined by the scale at which its residents live their lives; a scale that is no longer (if it ever was) parochial, but extends across time and space to connect people and practice across a multitude of locales. Contemporary understandings of Toronto can only be reached through adopting a transnational lens. This course will examine the processes that have produced Toronto as a transnational city over time, including the dynamics of immigration and mobility, experiences of alienation, the global extension of capitalism, and the (re)formation of communities grounded in the complex dynamics of identities produced in a space that is both ‘home’ and away’. We will also explore the specific practices, and connections that produce “Toronto” as a space that transcends its physical geographic boundaries and is continually reproduced in and through the flows of people, capital, objects, ideas, - and the many forces that reproduce and reconfigure these flows.</p>",

But what makes a protest Jewish? Is there something like specifically Jewish protest cultures? This course investigates an array of protests organized by Jews and for “Jewish causes” in modern times attending to the ways protests aren’t specifically Jewish and how they become agents of change. Rooted in the anti-lachrymose tradition of Jewish Studies, students will study protests with a view towards how Jewish traditions get mobilized across the Jewish diasporas and the ways in which they take a cue from and/or contribute to, purposefully cross-fertilize with or distant themselves from nonJewish protest movements transnationally. This class interweaves Jewish Studies with diaspora, subaltern, protest and performance studies.</p>",

This course will explore this intersection between the circulation of texts and languages and the movements of people, using translation to illuminate the experience of migration and migration to understand the trajectories of translation. Topics of the course include: the Bible in its worldwide dispersion; the metaphorics of movement in the translation theories of Schleiermacher, Steiner and Derrida; and the transnational/translational effects of imperialism, colonialism, and globalization. Moving from the global to the local, we will also explore the linguistic contours of the multilingual city. Finally, we will dive into the deeply individual linguistic terrain of the immigrant, studying the psychological and affective dimensions of movement from one language to another in both autobiographical and theoretical works.</p>",

As it spirals outward from parochial sites of origin to articulate with new sites, actors and scales, it assumes new substance and meaning in new locales. This movement of food gives rise to new ‘foodways’ t help us to understand the past in terms of temporally connected sites of intense interaction. Food also plays a strong role in shaping translocal identities. As peoples have moved in the world, food has played a central role in (re)defining who they are, reproducing myth and ritual, and bounding diasporic communities. This course seeks to address questions surrounding the dynamics of the food ‘we’ eat, the ways in which ‘we’ eat, the meaning ‘we’ give to eating, and the effect of eating in a transnational world. Recognizing that culinary culture is central to diasporic identifications, the focus is on the place of food in the enduring habits, rituals, and everyday practices that are collectively used to produce and sustain a shared sense of diasporic cultural identity.</p>",

In this course, we will examine the notion of sexuality as well as gender identity and expression from an interdisciplinary perspective that is rooted in ethnography. A cross-cultural study of sexuality and gender identity within global and transnational contexts will provide students with an understanding of how the intersections of culture, community, as well as social and political factors affect individuals’ sexual choices and understandings of gender. A particular focus in this course will be experiences of sexuality and gender within diasporic communities.</p>",
