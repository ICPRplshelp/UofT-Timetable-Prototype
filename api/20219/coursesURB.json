We will look at cities, real and imagined, to consider issues and concepts like urban design, housing, gentrification, art washing, uneven development, policing, Indigenous cities, and globalization.</p>",

They learn to design the required data collection tools for interviewing, focus groups, observation, documentation, and mapping behavioural patterns. To decrease the chances of being exposed to COVID19, students choose an open public urban space as their site and study people’s perceptions and attitudes through social media tools and document peoples’ behaviours to find their behavioural patterns by different observation techniques and mappings. After data collection and analysis, they present their findings with simple visualization techniques such as maps, timetable of activities and photographs. As the final product, they propose solutions to improve the quality of the urban space and people’s experience based on users’ feedback. Methods of effective presentation and seminar will be taught. Students will present their work in progress to the class and submit their presentation files as their assignments monthly.</p>",

Together, University of Toronto students and FOCUS Media Arts Centre journalists will learn about the multi-dimensional history of Regent Park focusing on topics such as immigration and racial formation, urban renewal, housing redevelopment, public health, and community organizing. Next, the U of T students and FOCUS journalists will work in teams to envision, research, and produce their own media project addressing a specific historical issue in Regent Park. Each group will be encouraged to connect their research to contemporary dynamics in the neighborhood. This project can be designed on any platform: radio, television, photography, print, or social media, etc. This course brings together a diverse group of individuals to generate new knowledge about our social world, social processes, and the ways in which we understand cities, specifically Toronto. The class employs a Participatory Action Research model, in which academics and community residents work together to design a scholarly inquiry, conduct research, and disseminate scholarly outcomes, and is explicitly committed to the democratic production of knowledge in the service of social change. Participation in the course accordingly involves a commitment to a new learning environment and a significant dedication of time.&nbsp;Students should feel free to raise questions or concerns about the environment at any time, but should be prepared for the time commitment and the new context.</p>",

The goal is to introduce students to intellectually rigorous, diverse, and critical debates on the nexus of policing, racialization, immigration, and urban security governance. We aim to problematize the common-sense understanding of ‘race riots’ through a historically grounded engagement with the politics of fear around the figures of the racialized excluded in Western cities (i.e. the native, the Black, the immigrant, the Muslim). We start by engaging with the roles of racialization, uneven development, and policing in the making of the figures of the criminal and the outlaw within the broader sociospatial relations of capitalism, colonialism, imperialism, and urbanization. Highlighting the importance of the conjuncture of decolonization, we focus on the racial, political, and sociospatial forces of ‘race riots’; the geo-political fear of the racialized excluded; the making and cementing of the criminalized figures of the Black, the immigrant, and the Muslim; along with the emergence and suppression of Black radicalism and anti-racist politics. We then assess the forceful, yet shadowed, afterlives of ‘race riots’ in the co-constitution of urban policy, policing, and citizenship, and how these afterlives have affected the current Black Lives Matter protests on both sides of the Atlantic. We conclude by discussing what these histories would and could mean for social justice and urban citizenship in our conjuncture.</p>",

Climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid densification and privatization bring additional pressures to bear on our conventional urban design models and understanding of urban public space, in both interior and exterior environments. In examining contested public space through the frame of monuments, public art and public actions, how may we begin to imagine new design models for flexible and resilient spaces? In facing an unknown future, how may public art inform design practices to support an open, social and welcoming urban environment? ***Students who took INI337H1S in the Summer 2021 Session (July to August) should not enrol in this course.***</p>",
