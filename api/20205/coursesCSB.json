        "courseDescription": "An online course intended to provide non-science students with an understanding of basic concepts in molecular biology and genetics, with particular emphasis on humans. Students will work online in groups on problem sets. The course will end with an introduction to biotechnology, including an opportunity for students to use their new knowledge to explore a real, multi-dimensional problem (e.g., cancer). Lectures will be delivered via the web and mandatory tutorials will require live webinar participation. The final exam will require attendance on the St. George campus. This course does not count towards CSB programs.",

While much can be done with tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices they are not guaranteed to work in all areas of the course. For an optimal experience you must have a laptop or desktop computer (Windows 10 or higher or Mac OS X 10.14 or higher is recommended).<br/>\r\n- Internet connection: High speed broadband access (LAN, Cable or DSL) is highly recommended for an optimal learning experience.\r\nA Web Browser is required for access to Quercus. In some instances, it may be necessary for some users to upgrade their web browser programs. A list of supported browsers can be found at https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10461-supported-web-browsers (Links to an external site.)<br/>\r\n- Speaker and Headphones: Many courses will have synchronous (live) online meetings using webinar software (Links to an external site.). It is preferable to use headphones with an attached microphone for synchronous (live) sessions.<br/>\r\n- Software: Word processing software will be required (If you do not already have this, Office 365 ProPlus can be found at https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/ic-faq-categories/office-365-proplus (Links to an external site).",

The topic is to be mutually agreed upon by the student and supervisor. They must arrange the time, place, and provision of any materials and submit to the Undergraduate Office a signed form of agreement outlining details prior to being enrolled. In the Fall or Winter sessions, a commitment of 8-10 hours per week is expected for research and related course activities. If spread over both the Fall and Winter sessions, a commitment of 4-5 hours per week is expected. In the Summer Session, the number of hours doubles per week (e.g., 16-20 for F or S, or 8-10 for Y) as the length of the term is halved compared to the Fall or Winter term. Many students spend more than this amount of time as they become immersed in their project. This course is normally open only to fourth year students with adequate background in Cell and Systems Biology. Course requirements include a final report, and either an oral presentation (Summer and Fall sessions) or a poster presentation (Winter session). Two workshops on scientific research are scheduled and highly recommended. Details for enrollment are available at http://csb.utoronto.ca/undergraduate-studies/undergraduate-courses/undergraduate-course-level-400/. (Lab Materials Fee: $25). Not eligible for CR/NCR option.",

The topic is to be mutually agreed upon by the student and supervisor. They must arrange the time, place, and provision of any materials and submit to the Undergraduate Office a signed form of agreement outlining details prior to being enrolled. In the Fall or Winter sessions, a commitment of 8-10 hours per week is expected for research and related course activities. If spread over both the Fall and Winter sessions, a commitment of 4-5 hours per week is expected. In the Summer Session, the number of hours doubles per week (e.g., 16-20 for F or S, or 8-10 for Y) as the length of the term is halved compared to the Fall or Winter term. Many students spend more than this amount of time as they become immersed in their project. This course is normally open only to fourth year students with adequate background in Cell and Systems Biology. Course requirements include a final report, and either an oral presentation (Summer and Fall sessions) or a poster presentation (Winter session). Two workshops on scientific research are scheduled and highly recommended. Details for enrollment are available at http://csb.utoronto.ca/undergraduate-studies/undergraduate-courses/undergraduate-course-level-400/. (Lab Materials Fee: $25). Not eligible for CR/NCR option.",
