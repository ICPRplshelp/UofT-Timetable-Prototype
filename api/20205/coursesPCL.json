        "courseDescription": "There is a critical need for a breadth of understanding regarding its mechanism of action, pharmacological effects and its potential benefits and harms (short- and long-term). Students will gain a breadth of understanding in cannabis-related topics including pharmacology and toxicology, its role in mental health and addictions, medical use, drug policy and new drug development that stems from increased access to cannabis constituents. They will learn to differentiate myths and anecdotes from evidence-based knowledge. Going forward it is imperative that students spanning basic sciences through business, arts and engineering have a comprehensive understanding of these topics. PCL218H1 will give students for a variety of academic backgrounds a basic understanding of the health implications of cannabis which have broad implications for both our professional and personal lives.",
