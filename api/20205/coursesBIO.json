Last day to enroll in a lab is end of day Friday July 3rd.<br/> You can find out your lab group (e.g., P0101A) by logging into Quercus and looking under the People section. The lab manual and all course information will be available on the course website on Quercus. For more information, please contact peggy.salmon@utoronto.ca. <br/>\r\nStudents need: <br/>\r\n- Personal Computer: You will need regular access to a computer preferably a personal computer with administrator privileges and you should be comfortable managing software and hardware. While much can be done with tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices they are not guaranteed to work in all areas of the course. For an optimal experience you must have a laptop or desktop computer (Windows 10 or higher or Mac OS X 10.14 or higher is recommended). <br/>\r\n- Internet connection: High speed broadband access (LAN, Cable or DSL) is highly recommended for an optimal learning experience. A Web Browser is required for access to Quercus. In some instances, it may be necessary for some users to upgrade their web browser programs. A list of supported browsers can be found at https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10461-supported-web-browsers (Links to an external site.)<br>\r\n- Speaker and Headphones: Many courses will have synchronous (live) online meetings using webinar software (Links to an external site.). It is preferable to use headphones with an attached microphone for synchronous (live) sessions.<br/> \r\n- Software: Word processing software will be required (If you do not already have this, Office 365 ProPlus can be found at https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/ic-faq-categories/office-365-proplus (Links to an external site).",
