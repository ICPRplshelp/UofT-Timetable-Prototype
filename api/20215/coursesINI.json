Although such ‘divided cities’ have their own unique characteristics, histories and urban contexts, they could nevertheless offer a lens through which we can understand the wider socio-political dynamics as well as the role of the urban environment in conflict. The course introduces spatial research approaches to cities facing extreme levels of ethno-national, political and religious conflicts. It raises the question of mapping as a political tool that can be abused, as well as the question of urban forms and architectural interventions in such highly-charged cities like Jerusalem, Belfast, Berlin, Beirut, Nicosia and others.</p>",

But before you can revise, you need to see your writing afresh. How can you escape the \"intractable subjectivity\" (Joseph Williams) of composition? How can you communicate your ideas more compellingly? INI 409 teaches ways to understand this essential stage of the writing process. It investigates different steps in self-editing: detaching from a first draft, reviewing it on different levels, identifying possible issues, and strengthening weak spots. We will draw on professional editorial strategies and time-tested writing advice to help us analyze both content and expression. Writers in different genres (scholarship, journalism, fiction) will visit the class to share their revision strategies. Each student will need a piece of writing to work on, one that the student wants to improve. It could be an academic essay or a science report from an earlier term, a short story or a piece of creative nonfiction, a newspaper article, or a personal statement for post-graduate applications. Course assignments will include applying revision strategies to this text.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Next, the U of T students and FOCUS journalists will work in teams to envision, research, and produce their own media project addressing a specific historical issue in Regent Park. Each group will be encouraged to connect their research to contemporary dynamics in the neighborhood. This project can be designed on any platform: radio, television, photography, print, or social media, etc. This course brings together a diverse group of individuals to generate new knowledge about our social world, social processes, and the ways in which we understand cities, specifically Toronto. The class employs a Participatory Action Research model, in which academics and community residents work together to design a scholarly inquiry, conduct research, and disseminate scholarly outcomes, and is explicitly committed to the democratic production of knowledge in the service of social change.</p>",

Through an examination of a mix of theoretical frameworks and case studies from Toronto and elsewhere, you will gain an understanding of the ways in which effective public participation can contribute to the maintenance of a healthy democratic society while also exploring some of the key challenges and opportunities faced by public participation practitioners today. The course has two key objectives: to give you a practical understanding of all of the elements of an effective public participation process, and to explore how public participation processes can be designed to be more inclusive and effective. In addition, students will be able to apply this knowledge towards the development of a project or report for a client.
