Students will have the opportunity to participate in <strong>synchronous</strong> and recorded, online tutorials once per week (Thursdays 3-5 pm or Fridays 9-11 am), which involve working through problems and Q&amp;A with a tutorial TA using Blackboard Collaborate. <strong>5%</strong> of the assessments will be for tutorial participation.&nbsp;<strong>Note – tutorial attendance is the only mandatory, synchronous portion requiring attendance for this course</strong>.</p><p>All material for lectures, tutorials and assignments will be available as downloadable pdf files through Quercus.</p><p>In addition to a high-speed internet connection for the viewing of lectures, participation of tutorials, and completion of online quizzes, students will also require internet search capability including the access to journal articles through the University of Toronto library network.&nbsp; Assignments can be done offline but will require the use of word processing software and the submission of digital pdf files.&nbsp; Students will also learn to use protein visualization tools either through the internet or by downloading free programs to their personal computers.</p><p>65% of the term work will be “take-home” assessments submitted at various points throughout the course. Online questions and quizzes completed on a weekly basis throughout the term will be worth 30%, and the remaining 5% will be for <strong>synchronous</strong> online participation during tutorials.</p><p>Blackboard Collaborate will also be used for online office hours (Thursdays and Fridays from 1-2 pm) for assistance with the content and questions regarding the assignments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
