Mobilizing examples from across US geographies and histories – such as Ford’s global automobile manufacturing empire, maquiladoras along the US-Mexico border, and the 2010s lead poisoning of Flint, Michigan’s water supplies -- we will study how racial differentiation, domination, and exclusion are intertwined with profit-making.</p>",
