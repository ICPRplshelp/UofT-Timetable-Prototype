Most of the class will be spent outdoors at various locations in Toronto, in activities that will foster connection with the season, natural elements, and other features and qualities—both human and not—of each place. Through guided writing activities, discussions of course texts, assignments and writing workshops, students will learn how writing informed by territory can expand their work, adding intimacy, immediacy, authenticity and depth. They will discover how stories wait in places, how the land, rivers and animals are storytellers, as well as our human kin.<br><br>This course will draw on readings and techniques in literary fiction of different genres (e.g., realism, speculative, fantasy), and a range of nonfiction. Students are invited to explore any genre. While you do not need experience with creative writing, you should have a keen interest in writing and a curiosity about and willingness to spend time outdoors, regardless of weather.<br><br>Course texts will include selections from fiction and nonfiction, featuring writers such as Teju Cole, Robin Wall Kimmerer, Martin Shaw, Barry Lopez, Rebecca Solnit, Leanne Simpson, David Hubert, and many more.<strong> Because the class will require some travel by TTC, students are also advised not to take another class on the same day.</strong></p>",

But before you can revise, you need to see your writing afresh. How can you escape the \"intractable subjectivity\" (Joseph Williams) of composition? How can you communicate your ideas more compellingly? INI 409 teaches ways to understand this essential stage of the writing process. It investigates different steps in self-editing: detaching from a first draft, reviewing it on different levels, identifying possible issues, and strengthening weak spots. We will draw on professional editorial strategies and time-tested writing advice to help us analyze both content and expression. Writers in different genres (scholarship, journalism, fiction) will visit the class to share their revision strategies. Each student will need a piece of writing to work on, one that the student wants to improve. It could be an academic essay or a science report from an earlier term, a short story or a piece of creative nonfiction, a newspaper article, or a personal statement for post-graduate applications. Course assignments will include applying revision strategies to this text.&nbsp;</p>",
