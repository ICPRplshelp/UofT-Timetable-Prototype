This and similar invitations in Jewish and Christian scriptures have inspired many great thinkers to try and learn something about the Creator starting from the natural world and human reason. But how far can this enterprise, known as natural theology, be taken? How is it related to revelation? And does it necessarily lead to the God of Abraham? In this seminar we will study a selection of important contributions to natural theology within, or in conversation with, Jewish and Christian traditions, including both classic (e.g., Thomas Aquinas) and more recent (e.g., Whitehead) authors.</p>",
