# Timetable


My code is really messy. The `HTML` files should be fine,
but my coding practices for the `.ts` files might
look really off to someone who is very experienced with JS/TS.

## How to change the colors

`src/app/timetable/utilities.ts` - this contains color info. Change this however you like. Note that not all colors can be changed from this file, but most of them can.

## How do I run this

Clone/download this repository. Open CMD, and `cd` to the directiory of the repository you've downloaded.

Or you can do this.

Type `npm start`. Then, head to `localhost:4200` on your web browser.

Note: make sure your computer can handle these commands. You need **Node.js** and **angular cli**.

## Development server

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.3.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
